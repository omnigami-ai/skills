# Remake spec: @twoclipping's chat launch, now Ostlery

Reference: https://x.com/twoclipping/status/2104446706741825818, from his
guide "How I Make $10K Launch Videos for $0 with Opus 5.5" (local copy
`reference/motion/twoclipping-chat-launch.mp4`, not committed; his prompt is
`reference/motion/twoclipping-chat-launch-prompt.txt`). Made in code by Opus
5.5. Measured on stills every 0.5 s, every frame around the fast moments,
full-resolution crops of each state, and the audio's onsets.

## Format
1920 × 1080, 60 fps, 14.77 s (886 frames). One continuous take, no cuts.
130 BPM: a beat every 0.4615 s, 32 beats. Kicks measured at 5.47, 5.92,
6.39, 6.84 … 14.23 s (spacing 0.461 s; the detector reads about 0.03 s
early), so the drop is beat 12 (5.54 s on the grid); every visual event
below lands within 3 frames of a beat.
Canvas `#f5f5f2`; outro `#0d0c0f`. Geist for UI; a serif wordmark at the end.

**Now Ostlery, tall (2026-10-17).** The reference was first rebuilt in three
shapes for an earlier example product, its screens drawn in code (the "First
rebuild" column below). It is now Ostlery's, tall only, on the app's captured screens, with
whole beats added wherever a result needs a second to land (43 beats,
19.8 s); `style.md`'s states table maps
every beat. The measurements below are still the original's.

The original is wide only, and everything below is measured in wide. Our film
adds square (1440 × 1440) and tall (1080 × 1920), laid out from these numbers
for their own frames: the same beats, other camera framings and scales
(`style.md`, "Shapes").

## World and camera
Everything before the drop and in the chat lives on a phone screen of
428 × 900 world px (11 px bezel, screen radius 44). The camera is one
transform: [t, zoom, x, y] = the world point at the screen centre, eased,
zoom interpolated in log space. Measured from the composer's and the bezel's
on-screen widths:

| t (s) | zoom | world y at centre | what |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | 2.74 | 70 (composer centre) | composer, 1 line, 1094 × 147 on screen |
| 1.00 | 2.87 | 83 | slow push while typing |
| 2.50–2.80 | 3.05 | 95 | 3 lines, 1213 × 311 on screen |
| 3.10 | 2.80 | 165 | pull back as the phone forms |
| 3.60–4.00 | 2.50 | 372 | on the thinking object; bezel 395–1526 px |
| 5.00 | 2.66 | 372 | slow push during the tosses |
| 7.70–8.00 | 1.50 | 384 | chat; bezel 622–1298 px (screen 642 px) |
| 8.00 → 8.40 | 1.50 | 384 → 520 | pan down to the pills |
| 10.10 → 10.37 | 1.5 → ~3 | the button | push into the growing button |

x stays on the phone's centre (214) throughout.

## Beats

| 11.62–12.05 | 25–26 | a dot rides a line (dotted ahead, lime behind) to a pin | amber signal dot |
| 12.05–12.30 | 26 | the pin becomes the brand mark (145 px) | the product's mark, amber |
| 12.46 | 27 | line 2 rises out | |
| 12.50–12.95 | 27–28 | mark spins once and moves into the lockup (115 px) | same |
| 12.95–13.25 | 28 | wordmark wipes out from behind the mark | the product's name |
| 13.30, 13.42 | 29 | line below rises; line above fades in | "Signal, not noise." / "Competitive intelligence" |

10–20% larger everywhere in the chat and never smaller.

## Colour logic (original → ours)

| Role | Original | First rebuild |
|---|---|---|
| canvas | `#f5f5f2` | same |

## Motion
- Springs: card burst (260, 22), lift (260, 18), pills pop (320, 17), mark grows (200, 15), composer height (300, 22).
- Flood radius grows as p^1.25 over 0.2 s, from the object's size to past the far corner.
- Text rises out of a mask line (ease-out expo, 0.3 s) and leaves through the top (0.22 s).
- The button's growth is log-space (a zoom), ease-out, 0.29 s.
- Motion blur: 8 sub-frames across half a frame (`--blur 8`).
